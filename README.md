# Pricing-Page-Ui

A clean and modern pricing table page built using HTML, CSS, and Ionicons. This project features a visually appealing design with three pricing plans (Basic, Standard, and Premium), clearly showcasing the features and costs of each tier. Each plan is highlighted with distinct styles for easy comparison, creating a user-friendly interface.

While it is not responsive, this project serves as a great foundation for static pricing pages in web applications or landing pages. It can be further enhanced with responsiveness and interactivity as needed.
